## Algorithms Used

### 1. Hungarian Algorithm (Optimal Matching)

**Purpose:**  
Assigns food donors to recipients in a way that maximizes total efficiency (minimizing distance, matching food types, etc.).

**How it works:**  
- Models the donor-recipient assignment as a bipartite graph.
- Uses the Hungarian Method to find the optimal matching based on a cost matrix (e.g., distance, food compatibility).

**How to run/test:**  
 Start the Flask backend (`python app.py` in the `backend` directory).  
  Send a POST request to `/match`

### 2. Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm (Route Optimization with Capacity)

Optimizes delivery routes for volunteers, minimizing total travel distance while respecting vehicle/volunteer capacity limits.

- **How it works:**  
Starts with each recipient as a separate route. Calculates "savings" for combining routes, and merges the best routes as long as the total food to deliver does not exceed vehicle capacity.

- **How to run/test:**  
Start the Flask backend.  
Send a POST request to `/route`

---
### Priority Queue (Food Expiration Management)

Ensures food items closest to expiration are delivered first, reducing waste.

- **How it works:**  
  Uses a priority queue (min-heap) where each food itemâ€™s priority is its expiration date. The soonest-to-expire food is always delivered first.

- **How to run/test:**  
Start the Flask backend.  
Send a POST request to `/next_expiring` 

---
### R-Tree Spatial Indexing (Geographic Queries)

Allows fast queries for nearest donors or recipients based on location.

- **How it works:**  
  Uses an R-Tree (or KDTree fallback) to index locations and quickly find the nearest ones.

- **How to run/test:**  
Start the Flask backend.  
Send a POST request to `/nearest`

## How to Run the Backend and Test the API

1. Install dependencies:  
 `pip install flask numpy scipy rtree`
2. Go to the backend directory:  
 `cd backend`
3. Start the Flask server:  
 `python app.py`
4. Use Thunder Client (VS Code), Postman, or curl to send POST requests to the endpoints above.
